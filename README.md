Python TCP/IP Chat
===================

For **python 3** *only*.

Run your `server.py` anywhere you like, edit the port to whatever is available. Then configure the `client.py` to match `server.py` configuration. Once that is done, lauch `server.py` followed by `client.py` to start chatting!

Commands:
---------
- `/list` - prints active clients
- `/log` - prints your messages
- `/exit` - Disconnects you
